## See the "Settings" section at https://github.com/lancachenet/docker-compose/ for more details

## Set this to true if you're using a load balancer, or set it to false if you're using seperate IPs for each service.
## If you're using monolithic (the default), leave this set to true
USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true

## IP addresses that the lancache monolithic instance is reachable on
## Specify one or more IPs, space separated - these will be used when resolving DNS hostnames through lancachenet-dns. Multiple IPs can improve cache priming performance for some services (e.g. Steam)
## Note: This setting only affects DNS, monolithic and sniproxy will still bind to all IPs by default
LANCACHE_IP=10.0.39.1

## IP address on the host that the DNS server should bind to
DNS_BIND_IP=10.0.39.1

## DNS Resolution for forwarded DNS lookups
UPSTREAM_DNS=8.8.8.8

## Storage path for the cached data
## Note that by default, this will be a folder relative to the docker-compose.yml file
CACHE_ROOT=./lancache

## Change this to customise the size of the disk cache (default 2000000m)
## If you have more storage, you'll likely want to increase this
## The cache server will prune content on a least-recently-used basis if it
## starts approaching this limit.
## Set this to a little bit less than your actual available space
CACHE_DISK_SIZE=2000000m

## Change this to allow sufficient index memory for the nginx cache manager (default 500m)
## We recommend 250m of index memory per 1TB of CACHE_DISK_SIZE
CACHE_INDEX_SIZE=500m

## Change this to limit the maximum age of cached content (default 3650d)
CACHE_MAX_AGE=3650d

## Set the timezone for the docker containers, useful for correct timestamps on logs (default Europe/London)
## Formatted as tz database names. Example: Europe/Oslo or America/Los_Angeles
TZ=UTC
